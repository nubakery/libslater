To install, please follow the standard procedure:
glibtoolize (or libtoolize)
aclocal
autoheader
autoconf
automake -a
mkdir obj
cd obj
../configure
make

You need to have a path to BLAS, GMP, and MPFR libraries. In addition, INCLUDE path to the boost library is needed.
They can be passed to configure by, e.g.,
../configure LDFLAGS=... 

By running SlaterGen, you will generate source files. They could be copied to ./lib to build a library.

The interface to the function is written in prefix/include/srootlist.h

The current set-up is a little conservative (i.e., less efficient). If you pursue performance, it is better to
find the best settings by changing NGRID or quadrature box defintion.
