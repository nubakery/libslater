This program the 2D interpolation routines to compute Slater and Yukawa integrals.
The citations to the original article / note are appreciated, when one publishes some product using this program.

To install, please follow the standard procedure:
aclocal
autoconf
autoheader
automake -a
mkdir obj
cd obj
../configure
make

You need to have a path to BLAS, GMP, and MPFR libraries. They can be passed to configure by
../configure LDFLAGS=... 


The generated files require some handling: s/e-/d-/g and s/e+/d+/g to be recognized as double precision.
Also, one needs to compile and link module.f90 (can be found in src) to use them, which allocates some stack area.

The interface to the function is

// subroutine root2(ta, ua, rr, ww, n)

where ta and ua are arrays of T and U (of length n) and
it returns quadrature grid positions rr and weights ww (of length 2*n in this case).


The current set-up might be a little conservative (i.e., less efficient).
Let me ask any question to Toru Shiozaki <toru@tshiozaki.net>
