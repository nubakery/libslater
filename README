To install, please follow the standard procedure:
aclocal
autoheader
autoconf
automake -a
mkdir obj
cd obj
../configure
make

You need to have a path to BLAS, GMP, and MPFR libraries. In addition, INCLUDE path to the boost library is needed.
They can be passed to configure by, e.g.,
../configure LDFLAGS=... 


The generated files require some handling: s/e-/d-/g and s/e+/d+/g for numbers to be recognized as double precision.
Also, one needs to compile and link module.f90 (can be found in src) that allocates some stack area,
or to make a similar routine. Note that the size of arrays is dependent on the rank of quadrature (NGRID in src/local_macro.h)
and therefore should be adjusted.

The interface to the function is

// subroutine root2(ta, ua, rr, ww, n)

where ta and ua are arrays of T and U (of length n) and
it returns quadrature grid positions rr and weights ww (of length 2*n in this case).


The current set-up is a little conservative (i.e., less efficient). If you pursue performance, it is better to
find the best settings by changing NGRID or quadrature box defintion.
