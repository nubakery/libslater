This program the 2D interpolation routines to compute Slater and Yukawa integrals.
The citations to the original article / note are appreciated, when one publishes some product using this program.

To install, please follow the standard procedure:
aclocal
autoheader
autoconf
automake -a
mkdir obj
cd obj
../configure
make

You need to have a path to BLAS, GMP, and MPFR libraries. In addition, INCLUDE path to the boost library is needed.
They can be passed to configure by, e.g.,
../configure LDFLAGS=... 


The generated files require some handling: s/e-/d-/g and s/e+/d+/g to be recognized as double precision.
Also, one needs to compile and link module.f90 (can be found in src) to use them, which allocates some stack area,
or make a similar routine. Note that the size of array is dependent on the rank of quadrature (NGRID in src/local_macro.h)
and therefore should be adjusted.

The interface to the function is

// subroutine root2(ta, ua, rr, ww, n)

where ta and ua are arrays of T and U (of length n) and
it returns quadrature grid positions rr and weights ww (of length 2*n in this case).


The current set-up might be a little conservative (i.e., less efficient).
Let me ask any question to Toru Shiozaki <toru@tshiozaki.net>
